    <h1>Affiliate Link Terms & Transparency</h1>
    <p>At <b>DETALED</b>, we strive to provide genuine, well-researched, and transparent product recommendations. To support our work, we use **affiliate links** to earn a small commission when you make a purchase through our links—at no additional cost to you.</p>
    
    <h2>How Affiliate Links Work?</h2>
    <div class="info">
        <ul>
            <li>When you click on an affiliate link on our site, you are redirected to a trusted e-commerce platform (e.g., Amazon, Best Buy, etc.).</li>
            <li>If you decide to make a purchase, we receive a small commission as part of an affiliate program.</li>
            <li>These commissions help us maintain our website, conduct in-depth reviews, and bring you the best recommendations.</li>
            <li>Affiliate links do **not** impact the price you pay for the product.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Why Affiliate Links Make Our Reviews Genuine & Authentic?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Unbiased Recommendations:</strong> Our reviews are based on **detailed research**, real user feedback, and technical specifications—not sponsorships.</li>
        <li><strong>No Additional Cost to You:</strong> Clicking our affiliate links doesn’t increase the product price.</li>
        <li><strong>Encourages Honest Reviews:</strong> We only recommend products that meet quality and performance standards.</li>
        <li><strong>Supports Our Work:</strong> Commissions allow us to improve content, test more products, and deliver accurate reviews.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Where to Find Our Affiliate Links?</h2>
    <p>We include affiliate links in our detailed reviews and recommendations. For example:</p>
    <a class="buy-btn" href="https://www.amazon.in/" target="_blank">Check This Product on Amazon</a>
    
    <h2>Transparency & Trust</h2>
    <p>We believe in full transparency. Our affiliate partnerships do **not** influence our editorial decisions. We prioritize honest reviews to help you make informed decisions.</p>
